Cyan Dotfiles

This is my first repo and will probably screw it up. These are my config files for Hyprland (which includes Hyprpaper), Waybar, Kitty, and Starship terminal. I will also include wallpapers used to complete the look. Mechabar by Sejji will have to be installed, so follow the instructions on that repo page before installing these configs. Also some of the config files here and many not included are from typecraft repo. Feel free to use these to create your own profiles. As this is my first repo, I don't have any idea about licensing or format for a readme or anything really. Hope you can figure it out on your own. Good luck!!
